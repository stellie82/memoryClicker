# Space Memory

## Objective
Space Memory is a memory game built using React.  The application renders different images of space objects to the screen.  The object of the game is to only click on each image once.  If an image is clicked on more than once, the user loses the game.

## Score Tracking
Upon each user click, the images shuffle in random positions and the user score is incremented until they click an image a second time, at which time the score will reset to **zero**.  The user can then try again and restart the game.

A _Top Score_ is also tracked so that the user can see the highest amount of cards they have clicked on without resetting the game.  A score of 12 wins the game.

## Technologies Used
